This assignment is designed to test your client-side coding skills and show us
what youâ€™re good at! You can add or modify any of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS
to complete the assignment. JQuery has been included for your convenience, but
is not required. Please do not use jQuery plugins. Also avoid frameworks like
Angular and Backbone. Please make sure the page works as a static page without
the need to run a web server or a build script.

First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority,
7-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way,
and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.

Second, pick at least two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose
whatever tasks you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills.
Browser support should include IE8+, Chrome, Safari, FF.

Tasks Sorted By Priority
========================================
 1  Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails
	currently in the page. Include an automatic slideshow mode, add prev/next
	buttons to manually control the carousel, add a layer that shows the
	contents of the images alt text.

 2  Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user
	to sort the reviews by review score.

 3  Improve the room table. Allow the user to sort the room table by occupancy
 	or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display
 	additional information about rooms.

 4  Add an interactive location block to the page. It should contain a map and
 	some nearby landmarks.

 5  Improve the facilities block.
 
 6  Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one.
	Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page. 

Priority Explanation
========================
Photos section needs attention first as it opens the images directly on a new page
 on-click and users need to click the back button which is not user friendly and
 might give the impression that the page is broken.

Reviews section doesn't look nice with this long list so needs a fix.

Room table doesn't look as bad as photos or reviews so it goes after that.

location block: It's a new feature so it can be added after making other features usable.

facilities block: Already looks good so the improvement can wait

JSON part: It should be done either at first or at last. As a front end designer I'm
putting it in the last place. After finishing the design I can just write some code
to populate the dynamic sections from JSON feed

Tasks Implemented
=========================
I've implemented the following 2 tasks. Note that basic functionality is the same
on different browsers but for modern browsers I've added some css3 styles
(transition/opacity/transform etc) which won't work on older IE. Also this was desktop
only implementation; I didn't optimize them for smaller viewports.

Codes added by me can be found by searching my name 'Afzal' or with some diff software
